                The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th
                century in the city of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to
                commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first
                British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Strand Road
                near Wellington Fountain.

                After its construction, the Gateway was used as a symbolic
                ceremonial entrance to India for important colonial personnel.
                The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British
                troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is
                located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the Taj Mahal
                Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. Today, the
                monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst
                its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering
                spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting
                services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community
                as it has been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with the
                lighting of the menorah, since 2003. There are five jetties
                located at the Gateway, of which two are used for commercial
                ferry operations.
